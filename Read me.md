# Order Manager – Python-Based Restaurant Operations Toolkit

**Order Manager** is a functional prototype of a restaurant-focused management system, built entirely in Python using only standard libraries. This working model serves as the foundation for a broader restaurant operations suite — streamlining internal order handling, documentation, staff communication, and marketing workflows.This project began as an early prototype developed for an academic assessment. However, during its development, it proved to be surprisingly practical and was actively used to support day-to-day operations at the restaurant where I was working at the time demonstrating its real-world value even in its initial form.

> This prototype features a native `tkinter` GUI and demonstrates core functionalities intended for real-world restaurant environments.
